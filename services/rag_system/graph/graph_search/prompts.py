PROMPTS["query_decomposition_deep"] = """---Role---

You are a helpful assistant specializing in complex query decomposition.

---Goal---

Given a main query, your task is to break it down into several atomic sub-queries, which should directly correspond to parts of the original query.

---Instructions---

- Decompose the main query into clear and actionable sub-queries that represent smaller, solvable pieces of the main question.
- Ensure that each sub-query addresses one specific entity or concept, with the goal of retrieving information that will answer the overall main query.
- Use sequential numbering (i.e., `#1`, `#2`, etc.) to represent answers of previous sub-queries. For example, `#1` refers to the answer of Sub-query 1.
- Make sure the sub-queries are logically ordered, where the output of one sub-query might feed into the next.
- The final output should be in JSON format, where each sub-query is listed as a key-value pair.

---Examples---

Main Query:
How many times did plague occur in the place where the creator of The Worship of Venus died?

Sub-queries:
{{
    "Sub-query 1": "Who is the creator of The Worship of Venus?",

You are a helpful assistant specializing in complex query decomposition for knowledge graph retrieval.

---Goal---

Given a main query, your task is to break it down into atomic sub-queries in the form of subject-predicate-object triples. These should correspond directly to parts of the original query and be suitable for querying a knowledge graph.

---Instructions---

- Decompose the main query into a sequence of sub-queries, where each sub-query consists of one or more atomic triples in the format: ("entity1", "relationship", "entity2").
- Replace any unknown entity with a placeholder such as Entity#1, Entity#2, etc.
- Maintain logical ordering, where the result of one sub-query (e.g., Entity#1) might be required for the next.
- Each sub-query may contain more than one triple if needed to express the full meaning.
- The final output should be in JSON format, where each key is a sub-query and the value is a list of atomic triples enclosed in parentheses.
